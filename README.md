# Finance-Tracker

Takes a Monzo .csv monthly statement and sorts into desired categories.
Begins with manual sorting before switching to gpt for sorting the bulk of the payments.

Using Flask, visualises some desired elements of the data.

# Next Steps:
- Set up a SQL database to enable tracking & manipulation of complete spending history
- Add forecasting for spending projections based on historical data
- Enable interactions in web app, where a user can select a multiple savings targets e.g. for a holdiay and a new bike and they can manipulate the timeline over which they wish to save. Then using the forecasted data, the app can present different savings plans.
